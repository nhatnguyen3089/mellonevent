# THIS PACKAGE CONTAINS MODIFICATIONS

This is not just a direct copy of tinymce 4.9.11 - it contains various security patches.

The source for this copy of tinymce is at https://github.com/silverstripe/tinymce/

To build out the dist files, simply follow the instructions in the readme of that repository, though note that you can run `npx grunt` instead of installing grunt if you want.
The relevant files will be in the `tmp/TinyMCE.4.9.11.nupkg` file that grunt builds out.
